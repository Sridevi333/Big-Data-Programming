•	LDA and LR are two widely used multivariate statistical methods for data analysis with categorical outcome variables 
•	LDA makes a few assumptions such as the explanatory or predictor variables must be normally distributed
•	LR does not need any underlying assumption made on the distribution of the data but it takes much longer time than LDA for computing.
•	From the below code execution we can say that the Accuracy is more in LDA than compared to LR
